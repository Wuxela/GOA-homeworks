                <li>Wrestling — particularly Kakhetian wrestling — is deeply rooted in Georgian culture and remains
                    widely practiced. Georgia ranks highly in Olympic wrestling medal counts, only behind Russia and the
                    US.</li>
                <li>Judo also enjoys great popularity, with stars like Guram Tushishvili, who won gold at the 2018 World
                    Championship.</li>
