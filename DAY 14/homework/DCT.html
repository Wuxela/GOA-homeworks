            It looks like you meant DCT gearbox,
            <br>
            which stands for Dual-Clutch Transmission ‚Äî but if you did mean DST.

        <h2>
            ‚öôÔ∏è What is a DCT (Dual-Clutch Transmission) Gearbox?
            <br>
            A DCT is a type of automatic gearbox that uses two separate clutches for odd and even gears,
            <br>
            allowing very fast and smooth gear shifts.
        </h2>
    
        <h1>
            simple right?
        </h1>
    
        <h2>
            üîß How it Works:
            <br>
            One clutch handles 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.
            <br>
            The second clutch handles 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.
            <br>
            While you're driving in one gear, the next gear is already pre-selected, so shifts are instant.
        </h2>
    
        <h2>
            Advantages:
            <br>
            Faster gear changes than regular automatics
            <br>
            Better fuel efficiency
            <br>
            Smooth acceleration (great for performance cars)
        </h2>

            Where You‚Äôll See DCT:
            <br>
            High-performance cars (e.g., Porsche PDK, VW DSG, BMW DCT)
            <br>
            Some sporty versions of regular cars
            <br>
            Racing and drift simulators sometimes offer DCT mode
