            What is a Manual Gearbox?
            <br>
            A manual gearbox (also known as a manual transmission) is a system in a car that allows the driver to manually change gears using a gear stick and a clutch pedal.

            How Does It Work?
            <br>
            The driver presses the clutch pedal to disconnect the engine from the wheels.
            <br>
            Then uses the gear stick to select the desired gear (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, Reverse).
            <br>
            After shifting, the driver releases the clutch, and the power goes back to the wheels.
