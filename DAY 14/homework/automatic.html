        <p>
            An automatic gearbox (also known as an automatic transmission) is a type of transmission in vehicles that automatically changes the gear ratio as the vehicle moves 
            <br>
            without the driver needing to manually shift gears.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            ðŸ”§ Key Features:
            <br>
            No clutch pedal: Unlike a manual car, thereâ€™s no need to press a clutch to change gears.
            <br>
            Self-shifting gears: The system selects the appropriate gear based on speed, engine load, and driving conditions.
            <br>
            Simpler to drive: You just select "D" (Drive), "R" (Reverse), "N" (Neutral), or "P" (Park), and go.
